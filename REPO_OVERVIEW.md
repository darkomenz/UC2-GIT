# <a href="#icon01" name="icon01"><img src="./IMAGES/signpost.png" width=40></a> Overview of the openUC2 projects and repositories

## The main repositories:

* [UC2-GIT](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-GIT) - This is the main repository. This one right here.

* [UC2-Software-GIT](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-Software-GIT) - This repository hosts all necessary software for the UC2 project.

* [uc2-configurator](https://github.com/openUC2/uc2-configurator) - (in development) webapp that allows for easily downloading relevant stl files for the uc2 system


## UC2-based hardware projects and more complex systems:

* [UC2_project_template](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2_project_template) - If you're starting a separate UC2-based project, please document it in a repository that follows this structure.

* [UC2_openSIM](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2_openSIM) - This is the repository for the openSIM project which integrates structured illumination microscopy into the UC2-system.

* [UC2_openISM](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2_openISM) - This is the repository for the openISM project which integrates a laser-scanning module for image-scanning microscopy (ISM) to the UC2-system.

* [UC2-MicronStage](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-MicronStage) - UC2 micrometer stage

* [UC2-Hi2](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-Hi2) - This device is intended to help you use a very simple GRBL-based Arduino Shield controlled by a Raspberry Pi/Nvidia Jetson to automatically image a multiwell plate to with a UC2-based microscope.

* [UC2_Fluorescence_microscope](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2_Fluorescence_microscope) - This is the repository for the laser-based fluorescence microscope with infinity optics. It is capable to acquire Time-Lapse videos from living cells inside an incubator.

* [UC2-Ptycho](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-Ptycho) - A first attempt to create a UC2 system that is creating Ptychography Data

* [UC2_openKOEHLER](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2_openKOEHLER) - This is the repository for the openKOEHLER project which integrates an adaptive diaphragm (e.g. variable effective light-source plane) in Koehler configuration into the UC2-system.


## UC2 goes ARRR! (Augmented Reality project - related repositories)

* [UC2-AR-RECOGNITION](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-AR-RECOGNITION) - Recognition models and tests used for the AR-recognition framework. This repository will be fused into the final AR-repo once enough development is done.

* [UC2-AR-APP](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-AR-APP) - All AR app related stuff will come in here.


## Others

* [UC2-ImJoy-Plugins](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-ImJoy-Plugins) - This is a collection of ImJoy Plugins which could be used for the UC2 Framework.

* [UC2_OFM-extensions](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2_OFM-extensions) -

* [UC2-Hackathon](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-Hackathon) - 2nd Photonics Days Makethon: Digital concept for university internships in physics and optics
