# PolarBOX

The PolarBOX is a UC2 ready-to-use toolbox built with 8 different polarization experiments using 3D printed unit blocks. You just need some essential and cheap components for preparing your own PolarBOX.  

I can hear the questions inside your head. Let's clarify your questions!

*What is the polarization of the light?*           

Polarization is one of the fundamental properties of light and is related to the internal geometry of the source radiation.

Our life is surrounded by unpolarized light in daily life, sunlight. Light is an electromagnetic wave. Electric field vectors of sunlight/unpolarized light vibrate in all planes randomly along the direction of propagation. When the electric field vectors are limited with a filtration mechanism to a single plane, linearly, or plane-polarized light is produced to the direction of propagation. In the plane-parallel or plane-polarized light, all waves vibrate in a single plane along the propagation direction.

The most common filtration mechanism is using the polarizing filter. Polarizers can be used to filter, modify, or analyze the polarization states of light in an optical system. The electric field of light can be polarized as parallel to the plane of incidence, p-polarized, or perpendicular to this plane, s-polarized using a linear polarizer.  

The electric field of light can be polarized as parallel to the plane of incidence as p-polarized light:

... or perpendicular to propagation direction as s-polarized light using a linear polarizer:

We can produce polarized light from the standard physical processes such as absorption, reflection, diffraction (or scattering), and birefringence.
